Credits to PJRC for Teensyduino (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html), which forms the basis of this hack.

Note that since it is based on Teensyduino, currently, the pinMode()/digitalRead()/digitalWrite() functions are limited to the pins which are exposed on PJRC's Teensy++ 2.0.

See pinmap.txt for the pin map
